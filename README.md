# The Herbarium Sheet

Annie works in a trailer at a field station, where she is in charge of collecting native plant species and weeds to mount on herbaria sheets for the natural history museum. Margarine tries to communicate with Annie, but Annie thinks that someone has hacked her terminal. Annie installs a webcam to catch the interloper. Margarine uses the webcam to look around the room. On the wall oppposite the desk is a travel calendar from 1929 that Annie found on eBay. It's a gift calendar from the Matson Lines to its best travellers, an advertisement to take a cruise to Hawaii and enjoy the dining and the festivals and the sunsets and the surfing. Annie has Zoom calls and sometimes asks her boss about the herbaria sheets she is preparing; she now holds them up to the web cam to explain more clearly the issues she comes across, overly thick stems, web specimens that transfer colors and moisture even haver weeks of pressing, and other undesirables. Margarine likes seeing the herbaria sheets when Annie holds them up.

Margarine made a present for Annie, a snake in the grass. Annie had been chased across the grass at the field station by a giant gopher snake. She talked about how beautiful the snake was, so big, and so full of purpose as it ran through the grass after Annie screaming to get away to get inside. Margarine made Snake in the Grass for Annie. Annie was not happy.

Herbaria sheets vary the world over, but a number of major herbaria have standard sizes. The Unite States standard size is 11.5 inches in width by 16.5 inches height.
The labels are 4.5 inches in width by 2.75 inches in height. Older ones were often 4.0 by 4.0 inches. 

The sheet has a plant, maybe its flowers, fruits, seeds, and leaves on a branch or stalk all mounted directly to heavy, acid-free paper after being pressed between newspapers under pressure for some time, weeks or months, to remove moisture. The label contains information like the name of the herbarium and the collection within the the herbarium where the specimen is housed. The plant name is its taxonomically accepted binomial name at the time of preparing the herbarium sheet. Plants usually also include the plant family, but not generally higher taxonomic classifications. This is followed by the location where the plant was collected and a description of some aspects of its exosystem, the latitude and longitude, the elevation, other common native species in the immediate vicinity, the name of the collector , and the date on which it was collected. In addition the label, major herbaria put their stamp upon the sheet, a seal with 1, 2 or 3 digits identifying the herbarium. The Smithsonian's initials are US, as it is the US National Herbarium housed in the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.

Coconut palms are huge, maybe 60-100 feet in heigt, trunks probably a few feet in diamter at least, and the leaves can be 10 feet long from the base of the rachis to the tip of the terminal leaflet. These will not fit on a standard herbarium sheet. What will Margarine do.

Gibasis geniculata, a member of the Commelinaceae family, a diverse plant family found in tropical regions in both hemispheres. This species is native to tropical North America according to a little stub of an article found on Wikpedia, but the herbarium sheet says it was collected in 1854 in South America (Paraguay). More later. The herbarium sheet has been digitized by adding a color palette, and a ruler with the herbarium's abbreviation.

The plant's official name is Gibasis geniculata (Jacq.) Rohweder. It is the species Gibasis geniculata, in the genus Gibasis, of the family Commelinaceae; its taxonomic relationships to other plants were first described by Jacq., the offical abbreviation for eighteenth to nineteenth century Austrian botanist, Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin, and these relationships and its name were later revisited by Swiss botanist, Otto  Rohweder.
